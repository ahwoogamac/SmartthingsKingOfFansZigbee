# Smartthings King Of Fans Zigbee device handler
Smartthings device handler for Home Depot Home Decorators Zigbee Fan (and fan controller) produced by King of Fans or Hampton Bay Universal Wink Enabled White Ceiling Fan Premier Remote Control. This device handler is based on  https://github.com/dcoffing/KOF-CeilingFan, refactored to work with new Smartthings app and to provide simpler user experience.

You can find the complete fan (including the controller) on the following links:

### Google Assistant fan Control

If you are using Google assistant you can set option dimmerAsFanControl to true to control fan speed using light dimmer.
Google assistant does not properly support fan speed dial, showing it as a light dimmer instead. When this option is activated you can set fan speed with the command in Google Assistant as "Set <FAN NAME> speed to <0 to 100>", where:
  - 0 to 24 is speed 0 (turn off),
  - 25 to 49 is speed 1 (low),
  - 50 to 74 is speed 2 (medium),
  - 75 to 100 is speed 3 (high),

Note that you can still use the on/off button as usual (fan on/off). To control light level, you must use child light device (shown as a regular light).

When dimmerAsFanControl option is activated, fan slider and dimmer will sync when any of them changes values as seen in the following animation:

Also note that Google Home sees the fan dimmer as a "brightness", but the device handler respond as a fan control. When you use the command "Ok Google, set fan to 15%", google you turn on fan level 1 and respond "Changing **brightness** to 15%" instead of "Changing **fan level** to 15%". You can also turn the fan on and of using the command "Ok Google, turn fan ON/OFF".

To control lights device child, simply use the command "Ok Google, set Fan **Light** brightness to 30%".

**Developer note: Please feel free to try Smartthings Git Hub Integration and validate if this issue is specific to my installation. **

You can also create a new device handler from code copying and pasting [king-of-fans-zigbee-fan-controller.groovy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafaelborja/SmartthingsKingOfFansZigbee/master/devicetypes/rafaelborja/king-of-fans-zigbee-fan-controller.src/king-of-fans-zigbee-fan-controller.groovy) and [king-of-fans-zigbee-fan-light-child-device.src](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rafaelborja/SmartthingsKingOfFansZigbee/master/devicetypes/rafaelborja/king-of-fans-zigbee-fan-light-child-device.src/king-of-fans-zigbee-fan-light-child-device.groovy) source code

### A note on https://github.com/dcoffing/KOF-CeilingFan

dcoffing made an amazing work with the legacy device handler https://github.com/dcoffing/KOF-CeilingFan. This device handler is not working with the new Smartthings app. For this reason I decided to make the needed changes and send PRs to contribute with the existing project, but unfortunately the project seems to be abandoned. 

This device handler has also a simplified interface and less child devices (no child devices for the fan, only one for the light).

This device handler would not be possible with all work and effort from dcoffing and all that contributed to the legacy device handler.

### FAQ
#### Why the fan buttons devices are gone?
A single 4 step slider is simpler to maintain and is already supported by most of voice assistants. If you would like to have, feel free to fork the project and send a PR. 

#### How can I use breeze function?
This functionality is not supported at the moment.
